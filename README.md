# Circuirty

Circuitry is a UI kit generation tool. Circuitry gives you the ability to quickly and easily create UI components for your web app with out relying on any specific CSS framework. You can style the components however you would like without being married to a particular framework or design style. Use whatever CSS framwork you like: Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, Tailwind, Material Design, etc, etc, etc.

Often times, you will find a great UI Kit but you don't like the styling or the styling won't go with your app well, so you have to settle for a UI kit you don't like, or maybe have to make your own, or you have to settle for a design style you don't like. Not any more. Drop this into your Vue or React app, give it whatever styling you want, and don't settle!
